## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

You can monitor the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} through any of the following regions only:
- `Dallas (us-south)`
- `Washington (us-east)`
- `Frankfurt (eu-de)` 
- `London (eu-gb)`

You must [create an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision) in `Frankfurt`, `Dallas`, or both to monitor the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service. 

| {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} region | {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} region where events are available |
|----|----|
| `us-south` | `us-south` |
| `us-east` | `us-south` |
| `eu-de` | `eu-de` |
| `eu-gb` | `eu-de` |
{: caption="Location of events per region " caption-side="bottom"}

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service.

To monitor the service, [start the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch) to access your events.

## Analyzing events
{: #at_analyze}

### Creating a workspace
{: #at_analyze_1}

When you create your first workspace, the following events are created by a {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} owned service ID and sent to {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}.

When you manage a workspace, the following events are created by the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service:
* An event with an action `schematics.instance.create`, when a first workspace is created.
* An event with an action `schematics.instance.update`, when a workspace is modified.
* An event with an action `schematics.instance.delete`, when a workspace is deleted.

The `initiatorId` of the request for these actions is set to a service ID that is owned by the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} service.

In addition, when a workspace is created, more events are also generated:
- Event with action `schematics.tag.attach` to report tagging of the workspace
- Event with action `schematics.instance.create` to report the creation of the workspace instance in your account
- Event with action `schematics.instance.update` to report updates to the workspace properties


You can search by `target.id` to identify all events that report actions on a workspace. For example, you can use a query such as, `crn:v1:bluemix:public:schematics:eu-de:a/xxxxxx:xxxxxxx:workspace:eu-de.workspace.observability-workspace.xxxxxxxx`.

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} are automatically forwarded to your {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance based on the regions. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} sends events to the `us-south` or `eu-de` region only. You can create an instance of {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} in the `us-south/eu-de` region to view event details. 
{: shortdesc}

1. Create a service instance of [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started) in the `us-south/eu-de` region. 
2. [Start the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} web console](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch) to access your events.
