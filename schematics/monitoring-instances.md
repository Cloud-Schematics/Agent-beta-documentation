# Monitoring {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} services by using {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}
{: #monitoring-instances}

[{{site.data.keyword.mon_full}}](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-getting-started) is a Third party cloud native, and container intelligence management system that you can include as part of your {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}}. Use it to gain operational visibility into the performance and health check of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, developers full stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards.
{: shortdesc}

You need to create Sysdig monitor in `us-south` region to view the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} metrics that relates to workspaces, actions, or an environment that you create in `US` region. And create Sysdig monitor in `eu-de` region to view the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} metrics that relates to workspaces, actions, or an environment that you create in `EU` region.

## Launching Monitoring UI from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} 
{: #launch-dashboard}

You can monitor your services instance in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
{: shortdesc}

Complete these steps to view your services instances:

1. Log in to your [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external} account by using your credentials.
2. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} page, select `Navigation menu > Observability > Monitoring`.
3. Click your instance to view the workspace and action that you created. 

   For more information about how to create a service instance? see [Create service instance](#create-instance).
   {: note}

4. Click the `Open dashboard` link, and expand `IBM` to view the `{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Summary Counts` and `IBM {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Summary Charts` dashboard list.
    - Use the `{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Summary Counts` dashboard to monitor the counts of your workspace state, action, and its success and failure status.
    - Use the `{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Summary Charts` dashboard to monitor the charts of your workspace by state, by type and outcome, and the vulnerability count.
