{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Blueprints is a [beta feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) that is available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage. Refer to the list of [limitations](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations#sc-bp-beta-limitation) for the beta release.

# Delete a blueprint configuration
{: #delete-blueprint}

When a blueprint environment is no longer required, it can be deleted which will terminate billing for all deployed resources. See the [deleting blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-delete-blueprint) lifecycle stage to understand the process of deleting blueprint environments and the steps. Deleting an environment is a two-step process that first destroys all the associated cloud resources (environment) and second deletes the blueprint config in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}.
{: shortdesc}

Deleting the blueprint configuration is the second step required to completely delete a blueprint from {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. To protect from accidental deletion, the config can only be deleted when cloud resources in all the blueprint modules have been deleted and the modules are in `Inactive` state.Â The first step is to run the [blueprint destroy](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-destroy-blueprint&interface=ui) command to destroy the resources in the blueprint environment and remove the environment. 

This behavior can be overridden using the `-force-delete` flag when modules cannot be returned to an `Inactive` state due to a {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} or Terraform error.

## Deleting a blueprint config using the CLI
{: #delete-blueprint-cli}
{: cli}

For more information, see the [blueprint delete](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-delete-blueprint) command. The `blueprint destroy` command must have been run first to destroy the resources, only then can the `blueprint delete` command run. 

For all the blueprint commands, syntax, and option flag details, see [blueprints commands](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-schematics-cli-reference#blueprints-cmd).

### Verifying blueprint config deletion 
{: #verify-bp-delete-cli}

The delete CLI command does not wait for successful job completion and returns immediately. 

The status of the delete operation can be monitored by using the `blueprint job get` command. The following command runs a `blueprint job get` for the JOB ID `eu-gb.JOB.Blueprint-Basic-Example.f2d388d3`. The job ID is displayed in the delete output. 

```sh
ibmcloud schematics blueprint job get --id us-east.JOB.Blueprint_Basic.992e4c2d

During the delete operation that the status shows `In Progress`, when completed the status changes to `Normal`. The blueprint configuration and all the dependent cloud resources are now deleted.

## Deleting a blueprint config using the UI 
{: #delete-blueprint-ui}
{: ui}

You can follow these steps to delete the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Blueprints by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

1. From the [Blueprints dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/blueprints){: external}. Click the name of the blueprint that you want to delete.
2. Select the **Actions** drop down list.
3. Select **Delete blueprint** option.
4. Type your `<blueprint name>` in **Delete blueprint** text box.
5. Click **Delete blueprint** button.

### Verifying blueprint config deletion 
{: #verify-bp-deletion-ui}

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Blueprints dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/schematics/blueprints){: external}, see that the deleted blueprint is not displayed.

## Deleting a blueprint config using the API
{: #delete-blueprint-api}
{: api}

Follow the [steps](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-setup-api#cs_api) to retrieve your IAM access token and authenticate with {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} by using the API. For more information, see [Delete a blueprint config](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#delete-blueprint) by using API. 

You need to run `blueprint destroy` command and then run `blueprint delete` command. For more information, see [Deleting a blueprint](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-delete-blueprint) configuration.

Record the blueprint ID that needs to be deleted. To list the blueprint ID, run [get all the blueprint instances](/apidocs/schematics/schematics#list-blueprint) command.
