## Blueprints
{: #glossary-blueprint}

{{site.data.keyword.bplong}} Blueprints is an [Infrastructure as Code](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-infrastructure-as-code-iac){: external} (IaC) deployment and lifecycle management service for large-scale cloud environments. It utilizes the analogy of building a house from a blueprint drawing. Where a blueprint defines the architecture, layout and the major building blocks. A builder builds the house from well-defined components using the blueprint for guidance. 

It builds on the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Workspace support for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Hashicorp Terraform. See [Working with blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-work-with-blueprints) for details of how to use blueprints and Terraform to create large-scale environments. When using the service, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} users create a [blueprint](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb1) to deploy and manage the cloud resources that are specified by a [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb2).  
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint
{: #bpb1}

A blueprint is the resource in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} a user works with to manage the group of modular environments and cloud resources created from a [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb2) and config. The blueprint resource in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} records the details of the template and the specific [configuration](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb3) details. All operations against the deployed cloud resources and modules are performed using the blueprint resource or ID. 

The blueprint (resource) maintains the record of operations run, job status, the cloud resources deployed, and the [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb2). It defines the infrastructure architecture and the unique input values that are used to configure the environment.

A blueprint is created with a [blueprint configuration](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb3). The set of cloud resources deployed by a blueprint is referred to as a [blueprint environment](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb4).
{: shortdesc} 

### Blueprint template
{: #bpb2}

A [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-templates) defines the infrastructure architecture, topology, and cloud resources for a solution architecture. The template implements the desired architecture from reusable [modules](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb5) that are written in Terraform. Template files are written to a [YAML schema](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-template-schema-yaml) and specify the Terraform [automation modules](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb5) to be used, their versions, Git source libraries, and the relationships and dependencies between modules. Template files versioned and sourced from a version control system, GitHub or GitLab.  
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint configuration
{: #bpb3}

A `blueprint configuration` is the initial definition that the user provides to create a blueprint. The configuration defines the [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb2) YAML file to be used, its Git source location. Also any [input files](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpi2) that will be used to customize the template, file version information, and additional dynamic (override) inputs. 
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint environment
{: #bpb4}

A blueprint environment is the set of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that are created from a [blueprint template](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb2) and the inputs that are specified by a [blueprint configuration](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpb3). It is composed of smaller linked modular environments.  
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint modules
{: #bpb5}

Blueprint templates are composed from IaC automation modules. Modules perform the work of deploying Cloud resources using open-source IaC tools. Initial support is for modules written in Terraform with additional IaC tools planned. Tools like Redhat Ansible and Helm, may be utilized today as blueprint modules using a Terraform wrapper. 

Refer to the section [using Terraform modules with blueprint templates](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-blueprint-terraform) for details on working with Terraform root and child modules. Examples of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} authored (child) modules that can be used with Blueprints can be found in the GitHub repository [Terraform IBM Modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules){: external}.

Each module in a template is deployed as an independent environment, managed by Blueprints as part of the overall application architecture. 
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint inputs
{: #bpi1}

A blueprint template, optionally declares a set of input variables that can be used to customize the blueprint template, while deploying or managing a blueprint environment.Â  The template metadata for the input variables include the following: variable name, variable type, default value, variable description, sensitive, readonly, hidden. 

Blueprint inputs can be provided as:
- User-defined input, provided via the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} API, CLI or UI at config create time. They can be used to pass input values that would be a security exposure if written to a Git repository.
- Version-controlled [blueprint input file](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-glossary#bpi2) (from a Git repository)
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint input files
{: #bpi2}

Version-controlled input file (from a Git repository) to pass inputs to customize the blueprint template for a specific environment. The type of an input variable is defined metadata in the template file. 
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint jobs
{: #bpj1}

Blueprint operations (commands) are run as jobs by {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}. A blueprint job keeps a record of the status, inputs, outputs, and files of every blueprint config, plan & run command execution.
{: shortdesc}

### Blueprint lifecycle
{: #bpl1}

Blueprints follow a lifecycle approach to deploying and managing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environments. The tasks of working with a blueprint over its lifecycle can be grouped under four headings, [defining blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-define-blueprints), [deploying blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-deploy-blueprints), [maintaining blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-update-op-blueprints), and [deleting blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-delete-blueprints). See the section [working with blueprints](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-work-with-blueprints) for more details. 
{: shortdesc}

## Catalog
{: #glossa-catalog}

A collection of automation templates that can be ordered from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can onboard your Terraform automation to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, and share the catalog of templates in a controlled manner with your team by using IAM permissions and policies. 

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog already supports a collection of {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} owned and Third party developed automation in the catalog. The automation is used to provision infrastructure and softwares by using Helm charts, Kubernetes Operators, OVA images, `Cloudpak` automation. {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Workspaces are used to run these automation.|
{: shortdesc}

## Inventories
{: #glossa-inventory}

A collection of cloud resources that are used as target for running the Ansible playbooks, modules, or roles. 
{: shortdesc}

### Resource inventory
{: #rir1}

A resource inventory can be defined by using a static inventory file, or dynamically retrieve to your target {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources from {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Workspaces in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
{: shortdesc}

## Jobs
{: #glossary-job}

A job maintains a record of the execution of tasks or operations for {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} `Workspaces`, `Actions`, `Blueprints`, `Agents` and resources. You can see these job records appearing in the context of `action`, `Blueprint`, and `workspace`. The job record describes the status of the Job, inputs used to run the job, outputs produced by the job and the console logs.
{: shortdesc}

## Templates or Modules
{: #glossary-template}

Automation code written for provisioning and configuring a cloud infrastructure by using Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Operators, and so on., in the IaC language. </br> You can use {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} to run the automation templates by using workspaces or Actions. 
{: shortdesc}

Modules are reusable IaC automation code that can be used to assemble an automation template
