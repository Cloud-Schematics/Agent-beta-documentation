# Sample Terraform solutions 
{: #sol-overview}

Various solutions show the strength of {{site.data.keyword.bplong}} and {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services when used together. These solutions use a simple Terraform template or module to set up the infrastructure. Even though each solution is presented through the lens of a particular use case, these infrastructures are typical across various industries. 

Use the published [Terraform solution templates](/docs/ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform?topic=ibm-cloud-provider-for-terraform-provider-template#sample) through {{site.data.keyword.bplong_notm}} to create your infrastructure, manage the resources, and use powerful tools to secure, manage, and monitor your workspace and actions.
